README DomainSPF.py

Performs SPF queries on a list of domains specified as a command line argument.
Then calls clean() in cleanIncludes2.py which resolves all domain names returned by the SPF queries.
Output: A text file containing all the IP addressses for the SPFrecords for the given domain.
	A text file containing all the DMARC records for the domains given.
	A text file containing all the output, including the domains for which there was no SPF record, domains that no longer exist and those that timed out.
	A text file containing only the domains that timed out so that this file can be rerun with a longer timeout period (lame list).

A tweaked version that provides some visual feedback when processing a large list
Changes DNS handling a little better to differentiate between no records returned, a timeout quering servers and a NX domain response

STATUS:
+ SPF record found
- No TXT record found
t Timout reaching listed Nameservers
x No such domain

Processed 51575 domains with  4975 having SPF records

TODO:
  - collects stats on timeouts and NX
  - write timeouts to a lamelist for trying at a later stage
  - allow a specific DNS server to be used ( allow for better caching)
  -  pre-read file to show proper progress %
